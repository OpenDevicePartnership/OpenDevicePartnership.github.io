    let project_what = "Patina is a UEFI compatible firmware interface written in the Rust language with a focus on memory safety and composition. For Patina, we re-evaluated the good and the bad from today’s UEFI boot firmware and used this opportunity to embrace new language capabilities, software architecture, programming paradigms, and industry supported tooling. Patina isn't designed to replace everything necessary for system boot but instead to provide a sustainable path forward with high return on investment";
    let project_why = "A lot has changed in the last quarter century. UEFI boot firmware has scaled remarkably well, seamlessly ushering in new generations of hardware for PCs, but as active maintainers of UEFI we know the systemic problems that can’t be addressed without significant change. We understand the challenges of supporting a vast, diverse ecosystem of hardware devices as unique as each user.  We see the nuance in our industrie's partnerships and the supply chains critical for their success.  For this reason, we started the Patina project to build a future and a coalition ready for the next set of challenges.";
