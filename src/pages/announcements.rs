                ", October 7â€“10 in Sunnyvale, California. Patina joins a growing portfolio of ODP projects aimed at building a secure, modern foundation for device enablement. To learn more about Patina, please visit the project page and documentation here: "

                "ODP is an industry-wide, open-source initiative focused on advancing " <strong>"security, fundamentals, and standardization"</strong> " in device software. The partnership's work addresses long-standing challenges in firmware and system design by leveraging " <strong>"memory-safe programming languages like Rust"</strong> " and " <strong>"hardware-rooted security features"</strong> " and doing so based on standards that will work across a partner's entire device product line. This approach reduces exposure to common vulnerabilities while providing manufacturers with a sustainable, consistent foundation that lowers engineering costs across product lines."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                "In addition to Patina, ODP is currently focused on three other major projects:"
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                "Together, these efforts give hardware makers the ability to standardize firmware and device software across their entire portfoliosâ€”improving reliability, accelerating time-to-market, and reducing redundant engineering work."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                "The Open Device Partnership is about building trust at the foundation. By focusing on memory safety, hardware-rooted security, and clear standards, we're making it easier for partners to deliver secure, consistent solutions while also reducing long-term development costs."
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                "With Patina's public launch and the ongoing progress of ODP's other projects, the initiative is now seeking broader industry participation. ODP invites partners, contributors, and stakeholders to join in shaping the future of secure, open device enablement."
